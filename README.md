# Skyline Query Algorithms

Java Implementation of Spatial Skyline Query Algorithms

## References
Algorithms are built based on descriptions in the following research papers:
* [An Optimal and Progressive Algorithm for Skyline Queries](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~dimitris/publications.html) by Dimitris Papadias, Yufei Tao, Greg Fu, and Bernhard Seeger.
* [Shooting Stars in the Sky: An Online Algorithm for Skyline Queries](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/pers/hd/k/Kossmann:Donald) by Donald Kossmann, Frank Ramsak, and Steffen Rost.
